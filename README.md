# ü¶Ñ Unicorn Company Data Analysis

This repository contains materials developed as part of a data analysis project for the Unicorn online platform from 2015 to 2018.

## üéØ Project Goal & Business Context

Through the analysis of the Unicorn company's database, I identified two primary issues whose resolution can secure the company's growth. The project's goal was to deliver actionable recommendations to the company's CEO, based on an in-depth analysis of sales, profitability, and customer behavior.

## ‚ú® Key Findings & Recommendations

* **Discount Policy & Profitability:** I found that the company's discount policy was the main factor causing sales to result in losses in certain periods and states.
* **Customer Base Growth:** My analysis showed that while customer loyalty is high, the number of new customers is declining, which poses a risk to long-term growth.

## üìù Project Tasks & Analysis

This project included three distinct phases of data analysis to answer a set of predefined business questions:

* **[Spreadsheet Analysis (Unicorn dataset analysis)](spreadsheets/README.md):** A series of questions were answered using Google Spreadsheets, demonstrating proficiency in pivot tables, logical functions, and conditional formatting.
* **[SQL Queries (Unicorn_SQL)](notebooks/README.md):** A more advanced set of questions were answered using SQL queries, showcasing skills in data aggregation, window functions, and complex data manipulation.
* **[Data Visualization (Tableau)](presentation/Unicorn_presentation.md):** A Tableau workbook was created to visualize key insights and trends, supporting data-driven decision-making.
