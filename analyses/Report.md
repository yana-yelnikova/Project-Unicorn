# ðŸ¦„ Unicorn Company Report

## Introduction

Through the analysis of the Unicorn company's database, I identified two primary issues whose resolution can secure the company's growth. I delivered a presentation to the company's CEO, outlining these issues and my recommendations for addressing them.

The company's profitability shows an average growth of **12.6% per year** but exhibits certain weaknesses: in the months with the highest sales figures, the company's profitability is negative. Furthermore, I conducted a geographical analysis of the company's operations, identifying the **five most profitable states** as well as **ten states that cause losses** for the company despite high sales volumes.

## Analysis of Key Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Unprofitable Discount Policy

I determined that the **discount policy is the main factor causing the company's sales to result in losses**. I recommended completely eliminating discounts exceeding **20%**. Additionally, discounts should be entirely abolished in the **"Tables," "Supplies," and "Storage" subcategories**, as discounts in these categories consistently lead to losses. Implementing these recommendations will not only increase the company's profits but also make previously unprofitable states profitable.

### 2. Stagnant Customer Base Growth

As a second avenue for the company's growth, I see the **expansion of the customer base**. The company has achieved significant success in customer loyalty, with **over 92% of buyers placing orders in 2018**. However, the growth in new customers was only **11 individuals**. I recommended implementing a new advertising campaign similar to the one in the first fiscal year, which brought the company nearly **75% of its current customer base**.

## Predictive Analysis

A predictive analysis was also conducted to forecast the impact of these recommendations:

* An increase of **100 customers** would lead to a profit growth of **$13,412**, representing a **14.4% increase** compared to 2018.
* Eliminating discounts greater than 20% (assuming all discounts exceeding this value are replaced by a 20% discount) would generate additional revenue of over **$240,000**, more than doubling the company's profitability by **2.5 times**.

I was unable to consider the impact of discount size on sales volumes, as this would require additional data, such as a detailed analysis of customer behavior in response to changes in discount size, as well as a comparison of the company's prices with those of competitors.

I also calculated a similar forecast for the unprofitable states and concluded that expanding the customer base in these states without simultaneously adjusting the discount policy would lead to an increase in their unprofitability.

## Data Quality

Regarding data cleaning issues, I identified minor inconsistencies in the supplier names: the indication of the same name with and without a period, as well as the use of product names instead of supplier names. For the purposes of our analysis, however, this specific cleaning was not required. These values should be cleaned if a detailed product analysis is required.

Furthermore, the database lacks information on the original unit price of the goods. This data was calculated using an additional Calculated Field.
